AGENT LOAD BALANCING WEIGHT		Released: 2023-03-27

This feature allows for agent load balancing according to a server's weight. Very handy when you have servers with different hardware specs.

To enable it, you must create a new settings container with the ID AGENT_LOAD_BALANCING_WEIGHT. Inside the container, you must specify one or multiple lines with the following syntax:

X.X.X.X,Y

Where X.X.X.X is each server's IP address, and Y is the weight you want to assign to each server. Any lines which do not match this syntax are ignored.

For example:

10.10.10.1,10
10.10.10.2,30
10.10.10.3,20
10.10.10.4,40

According to the example, the total SUM(weight) for all 4 servers is 100, meaning that the first server will handle 10% (10/100) of all agents, while the second server will handle 30% (30/100), and so on.

This allows us to set a higher weight for more powerful servers, and a lower one for less capable hardware.

If a cluster is missing one or more server's IP, the default weight of 1000 is used for those missing servers.

If no servers are defined within the container, or the container doesn't exist, the regular load balancing method is used (which would be the equivalent of all servers having the same weight).
